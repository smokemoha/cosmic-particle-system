# Cosmic Particle System

An interactive particle system that responds to mouse movements, creating beautiful visual patterns with dynamic colors and physics. This creative coding project uses p5.js to generate an immersive visual experience that you can customize through various controls.

## Features

- **Interactive Particle System**: Particles respond to mouse movements and clicks
- **Perlin Noise Movement**: Natural, flowing movement patterns using noise algorithms
- **Multiple Color Modes**: Choose between rainbow, monochrome, and complementary color schemes
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust particle count, size, noise scale, and movement speed
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to your browser window size

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Move your mouse across the screen to interact with particles
3. Click and hold to create a repulsion effect
4. Use the control panel to adjust various parameters:
   - **Particle Count**: Changes the number of particles in the system
   - **Particle Size**: Adjusts the size of each particle
   - **Noise Scale**: Controls the scale of the Perlin noise pattern
   - **Noise Speed**: Adjusts how quickly the noise pattern evolves
   - **Color Mode**: Switches between different color schemes

## Technical Details

This project demonstrates several creative coding concepts:

- Particle systems and emergent behavior
- Perlin noise for natural movement
- Mouse interaction and physics simulation
- Color theory and dynamic visual effects
- Responsive canvas design

Built with p5.js, a JavaScript library designed for creative coding and visual arts.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the code to create your own unique effects. Some ideas:

- Add audio reactivity using p5.js sound library
- Implement additional color modes or particle behaviors
- Create different interaction patterns based on keyboard input
- Add gravity or other physics-based effects

Enjoy exploring the cosmic particle system!
